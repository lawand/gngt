Introduction

German Noun Gender Trainer (GNGT) is a small application which helps German 
learners memorize genders of German nouns through memorizing their 
corresponding definite articles (der, die or das).

Usage

You should create a text file named 'noun.txt' and place it in the same 
directory in which GNGT is, the character encoding of this text file should be 
UTF-8. A UTF-8 file has been provided, so it is recommended for you to edit the 
provided file instead of deleting it and creating a new one because the default 
character encoding on some operating systems isn't UTF-8, which means that you 
have to specify this character encoding when saving the file instead of just 
saving it using default options.

The nouns file should contain some nouns each in a new line composed of the 
singular form of the noun preceded by it's corresponding definite article 
(i.e. 'das Buch' (without the quotes)). Note that erroneous lines will be 
reported by the program at startup and you'll be prompted to fix or ignore 
each of them.

It's not recommended to add compound nouns because the GUI won't fit long 
nouns, and memorizing the gender of the last part of a compound noun is 
sufficient.

You can then start the program and it will load the nouns and start testing you 
by giving you some random noun (i.e. Buch) and you should supply the correct 
corresponding definite article (which is in this case 'das'). If you made a 
mistake, you'll get a corrective feedback. Then you'll get another random noun 
and so on.
