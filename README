Introduction

German Noun Gender Trainer (GNGT) is a small application which helps German 
learners memorize genders of German nouns through memorizing their 
corresponding definite articles (der, die or das).

Usage

You should create a text file named 'noun.txt' and place it in the same 
directory in which GNGT is.

Then add some nouns into the text file each in a new line composed of the 
singular form of the noun preceded by it's corresponding definite article 
(i.e. 'das Buch' (without the quotes)). Note that erroneous lines will be 
reported by the program at startup and will be ignored.

It's not recommended to add compound nouns because the GUI won't fit long 
nouns, and memorizing the gender of the last part of a compound noun is 
sufficient.

You can then start the program and it will load the nouns and start testing you 
by giving you some noun (i.e. Buch) and you should supply the correct 
corresponding definite article (which is in this case 'das'). If you made a 
mistake, you'll get a corrective feedback. Then you'll get another random noun 
and so on.

Developing

GNGT is a Qt4 application, and is tested with Qt v4.7.0.
