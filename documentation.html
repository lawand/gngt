<div id="Header">German Noun Gender Trainer (GNGT)</div>

<div id="Content">

	<h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>German Noun Gender Trainer (GNGT) is a small application which helps German learners memorize genders of German nouns through memorizing their corresponding definite articles (der, die or das).</p>
    
    <h1>Usage</h1>
    <p>Before you can start using the program, you should add some nouns and set their genders. You can do so by selecting the "edit nouns" option from the file menu. You can modify the nouns later in the same way.</p>
	<p>It's not recommended to add compound nouns because the program interface won't fit long nouns, and memorizing the gender of the last part of a compound noun is sufficient. The program allows a maximum of 23 characters for both the singular form and the plural form of any noun.</p>
	<p>When adding new nouns, a singular form must be entered, but a plural form is optional. However, it's highly recommended to look up plural forms and add them so that both singular and plural forms are memorized.</p>
	<p>After adding some nouns, you can start using the program which would test you by giving you some random noun (i.e. Buch) and you should supply the correct corresponding definite article (which is in this case 'das'). If you made a mistake, you'll get a corrective feedback. And either ways, you'll get another random noun afterwards, and so on.</p>
	<p>Each noun has a memorization streak, that is, the number of sequential times that it's gender was chosen correctly by the user. A single mistake resets the streak back to 0. When a streak reaches 10, the corresponding noun is considered memorized, and is removed.</p>
	<p>All nouns are stored in a text file named "nouns.txt". You can copy the file into another platform and use it there because the format and character encoding of the file is consistent across all platforms.</p>
	
	<h1>Windows Platform Notes</h1>
	<p>The nouns file "noun.txt" should be placed in the same directory in which GNGT is.</p>
	<p>Keyboard shortcuts are indicated by underlining the letters that correspond with the button which should be pressed together with the Alt key to access the function. For instance, to choose the masculine definite article button (der) in the main window you should press the Alt button together with the R button because the letter 'r' is underlined.</p>
	<p>Underlining might not appear automatically, in which case you should press the Alt key to make it appear.</p>
	<p>Only one shortcut isn't indicated, and that is the delete key which removes highlighted nouns in the edit nouns dialog.</p>
	
	<h1>Ubuntu Linux Platform Notes</h1>
	<p>The nouns file "nouns.txt" is stored at "~/.gngt/nouns.txt", which would typically be /home/USERNAME/.gngt/nouns.txt. Note that the directory "~/.gngt/" is typically hidden.</p>
	<p>The nouns file doesn't get deleted when uninstalling GNGT.</p>
	<p>Keyboard shortcuts are indicated by underlining the letters that correspond with the button which should be pressed together with the Alt key to access the function. For instance, to choose the masculine definite article button (der) in the main window you should press the Alt button together with the R button because the letter 'r' is underlined.</p>
	<p>Underlining might not appear automatically, in which case you should press the Alt key to make it appear.</p>
	<p>Only one shortcut isn't indicated, and that is the delete key which removes highlighted nouns in the edit nouns dialog.</p>
	
	<h1>Maemo Linux Platform Notes</h1>
	<p>The nouns file "nouns.txt" is stored at "/home/user/MyDocs/Others/nouns.txt", and doesn't get deleted when uninstalling GNGT.</p>
	<p>Tip: To enter a lot of nouns quickly, open the edit nouns dialog, and don't use the touch screen to click on any button, instead use the keyboard. Press the Enter button to add a new noun and press it again after typing the noun to confirm. You can then repeat this process as much as needed.</p>
	
	<h1>Symbian Platform Notes</h1>
	<p>The nouns file "nouns.txt" is stored at "C:\data\Others\", and doesn't get deleted when uninstalling GNGT.</p>
	<p>On smart phones that don't have a touch screen, there are some numpad shortcuts which are indicated by mentioning the number that corresponds with the button that should be pressed to access the function.</p>
	<p>Note: If some text in the program interface wasn't readable, try changing the device theme (default themes are usually well-designed regarding this aspect)</p>
	
	<h1>Advanced Usage</h1>
	<p>The character encoding of the nouns file 'nouns.txt' is UTF-8. You can edit the file manually but it's recommended for you to edit the nouns using the program interface because the default character encoding on some operating systems isn't UTF-8, which means that you have to specify this character encoding when saving the file instead of just saving it using default options.</p>
	<p>The nouns in the nouns file should be each in a different line composed of the singular form of the noun preceded by it's corresponding definite article and (optionally) followed by the plural form and then (again optionally) followed by the memorization streak (i.e. 'das Auto Autos' (without the quotes)). Note that erroneous lines will be reported by the program at startup, and you can fix them using the program interface.</p>
	<p>Duplicates get removed when reading nouns at startup.</p>
